# 🤖 OpenAI Agent SDK - Handoff System for Billing and Refund Support

This project demonstrates a multi-agent system using the [OpenAI Agent SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/agents) with **handoff capabilities** between agents based on the user’s intent (Billing or Refund).

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Structure**: Three agents:
  - `main_agent` – acts as the central manager and delegates tasks.
  - `billing_agent` – handles billing issues.
  - `refund_agent` – handles refund-related queries.
  
- **Handoff Functionality**: 
  - User queries are intelligently routed using `handoff()` based on keywords (e.g., "billing", "refund").
  - Custom `on_handoff()` functions are triggered when handoffs occur.
  
- **Logging & Verbose Output**:
  - `enable_verbose_stdout_logging()` is used to clearly trace each step and decision made during agent interactions.

---

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Define Agents**:
    - Agents are given specific instructions and handoff descriptions.
  
2. **Create Input Schema**:
    - A `handoff_cls_Input` Pydantic model captures user data like `order_id` and `reason`.

3. **Define Handoff Logic**:
    - `handoff_on_billing()` and `handoff_on_refund()` functions are defined to log context-specific data.
  
4. **Configure Handoff Tools**:
    - Each agent is wrapped using the `handoff()` function and registered under the `main_agent`.

5. **Run the System**:
    - The `Runner.run_sync()` function initiates the agent loop with a natural language user query.
